VERY EASY: Create a bulleted list of the colors of the rainbow

EASY: Create an HTML page with a main headline, two subheads in their own sections and supporting text for each subhead. Topic is up to you. Make sure you have a page title.

MEDIUM: Using semantic HTML, add a footer with a copyright year and social media links (minimum of 3). Add a sidebar with links to outside content.

HARD: Create a contact page with an HTML form with a GET method that will collect the following: First Name, Last Name, Gender (have them pick), Favorite sport (from a dropdown list of at least 5), Checkboxes for what you like on your pizza (from a list of at least 5) and
the submit button should read, "Save".

VERY HARD: On the same site, create a horizontal navigation of 5 items, one of the items should have a dropdown menu when you hover over it.

VERY HARD: Given a comma separated string of full names, use JavaScript to create an alphabetical-by-Last-Name, ordered list and have it display in an HTML page on your site. Make the last names bold and red using CSS (NOT inline styles).

## Note: Don't freak out about the last one

LAST, BUT NOT LEAST: Make sure to post your site in Github pages.
