  * CSS Variables: Created custom values that are meant to be reused for styling
  * SASS: Preprocessing scripting language that is compiled into CSS. It uses indentation to separate code blocks and newline characters to separate rules.
  * SCSS: The newer syntax of SASS. It uses the same block formatting as CSS such as using curly braces to denote code blocks and semicolons to separate lines within a block. This allows you to use the syntax that youâ€™re familiar with while allowing you to take advantage of the more versatile syntax that SASS offers.
